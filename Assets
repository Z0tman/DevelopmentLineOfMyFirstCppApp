Why aren't there any asset for the next part of the development guide line if it will be a game mecanic ?

It is not that simple. Throwing out pictures about the feudal period is not that simple, because the core strategy is currently missing something.

To keep your code universal, the less constraint you give to it, the most versatile it will be to implement better rules for the real time war strategy game online.

It is not easy to be a real fan of that, because my code is juste a prototype, but people who don't mind about the game type can make a greater job than me.

Then, what else ?

I am not wasting resources for random quality on purposed game mecanics controversial development.

The hardware setting remains unstable because it is changing all the time.

Then, let's make the game closer to that hidden reality.

A too powerful army should involve a risk of TK (friendly kill attack).

Then, what could be the outcome of the next pro game on real time war strategy games ?

Life is hard, but coding can make it be simpler if done correctly by simply giving an abstract role to the feudal classes.

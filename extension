Why I did not write the whole code as a game prototype ?

If I didn't it is because the prototype operator is more than enough to try a template extension.

If you do so, the best part of the challenge is at the beginning : which game concept will allow you to use a process fusion to fuse skills, objects, attacks FX, mix FX and so on ?

The blending functionalities are impressive, but working only on strings may not be the best way doing so.

That doesn't mean to try to complete the development guideline.

Since I lack of experience in the field of coding, I won't state anything of the sort.

So, if the guideline is too easy, the best part is how to implement a new template functionality which will allow you to extend the blending features into your game engine.

I think about unreal engine, but that can be possible also for unity or any other game engine.

I never tried to make a plugin, but that could be a good start to simply share the prototype version, because making work which will not necessarily be compatible with other workflows

would be irrelevant.

Here, the mistake is very small, it is just about the type variable handling.

If the built-in method is not enough, you will have to write a custom method for a template extend type by yourself.

Well, that won't make advance the program as fast as simply following the guidline, but that will make you think of it as a new way to blend things together.

The result of the first analysis of my first C++ application is over.

It seems that there is a conflict definition between french and english america languages concerning the word "subprime".

Here I brought a new brand definition inherited from my prototype operators, but people should ban fake encyclopedist from wikipedia spreading wrong words.

That could be the first application of my game concept prototype : banning the imperials from all of the platforms, or ban the platform itself it brings conflict for nothing.

Life is hard, but code can make it simpler.

Why french people think of subprime as a financial crisis ?

Subprime is just a name type when prime numbers are filtered by a subitem method as explained in my game concept prototype...

People cannot contest the fact that the instructionals must be separated because the non-english speaker won't understand the french instructional and vice-versa.

What frnehcmen does understand my using a word that spreads fake definition ?

My guidlines may be the main condition to steer ourselves alive from the covid-19.
